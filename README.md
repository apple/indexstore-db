# IndexStoreDB



IndexStoreDB is a source code indexing library. It provides a composable and efficient query API for looking up source code symbols, symbol occurrences, and relations. IndexStoreDB uses the libIndexStore library, which lives in [apple/llvm-project](https://github.com/apple/llvm-project/tree/apple/main/clang/tools/IndexStore), for reading raw index data. Raw index data can be produced by compilers such as Apple Clang and Swift using the `-index-store-path` option. IndexStoreDB enables efficiently querying this data by maintaining acceleration tables in a key-value database built with [LMDB](http://www.lmdb.tech/).


IndexStoreDB's data model is derived from libIndexStore. For more information about libIndexStore, and producing raw indexing data, see the [Indexing While Building](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cH2sTpgSnJZCkZtJl1aY-rzy4uGPcrI-6RrUpdATO2Q/) whitepaper.

## Building IndexStoreDB

IndexStoreDB is built using the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

For a standard debug build and test:

```sh
$ swift build
$ swift test
```

### Building on Linux

The C++ code in the index requires `libdispatch`, but unlike Swift code, it cannot find it automatically on Linux. You can work around this by adding a search path manually.

```sh
$ swift build -Xcxx -I<path_to_swift_toolchain>/usr/lib/swift -Xcxx -I<path_to_swift_toolchain>/usr/lib/swift/Block
```

## Some Example Users

[**Pecker**](https://github.com/woshiccm/Pecker): a tool to detect unused code based on [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax.git) and [IndexStoreDB](https://github.com/apple/indexstore-db.git).
